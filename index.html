			<p>Hmmm... You're a good pilot right? - Jonathan</p>
			<p>Pff! I'm one of the best! - User</p>
			<p>Ha ha! That's why you're flying a cargo ship? Ha ha! - Jonathan</p>
			<p>What's your point? - User</p>
			<p>You can handle this on your own for a few minutes, right? I'm going to check out those boxes.</p>
			<p>FIne, yiu have two minutes. Im counting! - User</p>
			<p>Thanks! - Jonathan runs off</p>
			<p>Kids these days. - User</p>
			<p>User turns on the cargo bay cameras.</p>
			<p>What do you see? - User through intercom</p>
			<p>WHOA! User, this is insane! - Jonathan through intercom</p>
			<p>What is it?! - User through intercom</p>

			<p>*BOOM!*</p>
			<p>The ship jerks violently!</p>
			<p>AHHHH! - Jonathan through intercom</p>
			<p>The cargo bay door rips off. Jonathan quickly grabs on to a pole. Everything that has not been strapped down flies out into open space.</p>
			<p>Jonathan! Hold on! - User</p>
			<p>I... I can't! AHHH! - Jonathan's hands slip off the pole. He flies right out of the ship.</p>
			<p>NOOO! JONATHAN!!! - User</p>
			<p>The ships tilts downwards. All controll has been lost, the ship spirals downwards towards the mysterious plantet of Uganda X.</p>
